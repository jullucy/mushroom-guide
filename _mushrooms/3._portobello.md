### Scientific Name:
Open Cap Mushroom Portobellos are the most mature version of the Agaricus bisporus species; they are the bigger older brother of white buttons and creminis.

### Description:
They have very dark brown to black caps with very thick stems. They are meaty and have a rich flavor, making them perfect for grilling, broiling, and roasting. Portobellos are also fantastic meat substitutes in vegetarian and vegan dishes. Their size and meaty flavor make them perfect to act as a burger pattie, a vegetarian pizza topping, or even a carb-free burger bun.
