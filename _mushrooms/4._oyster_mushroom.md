### Scientific Name:
Pleurotus Ostreatus, Tree Oyster Mushrooms, Pearl Oyster Mushrooms Oyster mushrooms get their name for their oyster-like shape.

### Description:
Their color can range from white to cream to light tan or grayish-blue, and they grow in clusters. The younger the oyster mushrooms are, the more flavorful; they taste slightly sweet and nutty with hints of anise. Their texture is quite different from other types of mushrooms; they are delicate, paper-thin, and almost fragile but become tender, chewy, and meaty when cooked. Oyster mushrooms are a popular ingredient in vegetarian dishes and taste fantastic when battered or fried.
