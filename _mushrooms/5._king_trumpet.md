### Scientific Name:
King Oyster Mushroom, French Horn Mushroom, King Brown Mushroom, Trumpet Royale King Trumpet Mushrooms are often referred to as king oyster mushrooms as they belong to the same family of Pleurotus and are the largest of the species.

### Description:
Yet they look and taste quite different. King oyster mushrooms are much larger with long, thick, smooth meaty stems and stout brown caps. Unlike oyster mushrooms, they donâ€™t cluster but grow separately. Raw king trumpets have little flavor, but they become savory, meaty, and chewy when cooked, absorbing the flavors of the ingredients and spices around them. They are the number one meat substitutes among the mushroom variety, and you should treat them like you would a nice cut of meat - roast, grill, sautee, or fry.
