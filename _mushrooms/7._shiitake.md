Lentinula Edodes, Sawtooth Oak Mushroom", Black Forest Mushroom, Golden Oak Mushroom Shiitake mushrooms are native to East Asia and have been cultivated for over 6000 years.

### Description:
They have long slender stems and a slightly curved umbrella-like brown cap.

When cooked, they have a smoky, deep earthy flavor and soft meaty texture. Dried shiitake mushrooms are very common in Japanese and Chinese cuisine.
