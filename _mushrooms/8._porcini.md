### Scientific Name:
Boletus Edulis, King Bolete, Cèpe, Steinpilz ("stone mushroom" in German), Penny Bun Porcini means "piglets" in Italian and are the most beloved mushroom in Italian cuisine.

### Description:
They have long meaty white stems and reddish-brown caps that are slightly sticky to touch. They are quite large mushrooms with an incredibly robust nutty flavor and intense aroma. Fresh porcinis are considered gourmet mushrooms - they are not easy to find and can be pretty pricey. You can often find them dried, and they are also very flavorful. Porcinis are most commonly used in brown sauces, risottos, and pasta—their luscious unmistakable flavor pairs well with pancetta, anchovies, and garlic. You shouldn't eat raw porcini mushrooms. One of the proteins in raw porcini is indigestible by humans and can irritate one's stomach. Another reason to cook porcini before eating is that their thick spongy stems often are homes for worms. Even though the worms are harmless, you should examine the mushrooms for small holes when selecting them.
