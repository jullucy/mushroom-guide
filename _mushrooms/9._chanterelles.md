### Scientific Name:
Cantharellus Cibarius, Golden Chanterelle, Girolle Chanterelles are one of the world's most popular types of wild mushrooms.

### Description:
They are mycorrhizal, meaning they form a symbiotic relationship with the roots of trees. Chanterelles vary in size and color - they usually come in shades of orange and yellow and are unmistakable for their slightly inverted fan or trumpet-like shape with gills running up the stem and under the cap. They are famous for their rich earthy flavor, sweet fruity aroma, and delightful, slightly chewy yet firm texture. You can have chanterelles raw when available or use the simplest cooking methods to retain the most of their naturally delicious flavor.
